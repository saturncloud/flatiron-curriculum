# NetworkX Introduction - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice some of the introductory skills for creating graphs using the NetworkX library introduced in the previous lesson. To do this, you'll create a graph to visualize users and businesses from yelp reviews. 

## Objectives

In this lab you will: 

- Create basic network graphs with networkx 
- Add nodes and edges to networkx graphs 
- Visualize network graphs with networkx 

## Import the Data

To start, import the data stored in the file `'Yelp_reviews.csv'`. 


```python
# Your code here
```

## Creating a Graph

Now, create an initial graph!


```python
# Your code here
```

## Adding Nodes 

Create a node for each user and each business in the dataset. Networks with multiple node types like this are called **bimodal networks**.

Optionally, go further by creating a list of colors for when you visualize the graph. If you do this, append the color "green" to your color list every time you add a user node and append the color "blue" to your color list every time you add a business node.


```python
# Your code here
```

## Adding Edges

Next, iterate through the dataset and create an edge between users and the businesses they have reviewed.


```python
# Your code here
```

## Visualizing the Graph

Finally, create a visualization of your network. If you chose to color your nodes, pass the list of colors through the optional `node_color` parameter.


```python
# Your code here
```

## Summary

Nice work! In this lab you created an initial network to visualize a bimodal network of businesses and yelp reviewers!
