# Random Forest Classifier in PySpark - Lab

### Objectives
* Use the kaggle eCommerce dataset in the previous lab and reimplement using PySpark

In this lab, we will use the `RandomForestClassifier` from PySpark to study the differences on CPU/memory consumption between the pandas version. While implementing, do checkout `localhost:4040` to examine the Spark UI for job execution and memory consumption, and how it differs on the model computation time when only used pandas.
