Instead, it is important to point out here that the typical workflow would be more centered on using the weights from a prettrained model to fine-tine a classifier on images with classes similar to those seen in the original training set (i.e., [ImageNet's 1000 classes](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/)), a process known as transfer learning.\n",

    "### The typical transfer-learning workflow\n",
    "This leads us to how a typical transfer learning workflow can be implemented in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2.   Freeze all layers in the base model by setting `trainable = False`.\n",
    "3.   Create a new model on top of the output of one (or several) layers from the base model.\n",
    "4.   Train your new model on your new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an alternative, more lightweight workflow could also be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2.   Run your new dataset through it and record the output of one (or several) layers from the base model. This is called *feature extraction*.\n",
    "3.   Use that output as input data for a new, smaller model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of that second workflow is that you only run the base model once on your data, rather than once per epoch of training. So it's a lot faster & cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with that second workflow, though, is that it doesn't allow you to dynamically modify the input data of your new model during training, which is required when doing data augmentation, for instance. Transfer learning is typically used for tasks when your new dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch, and in such scenarios data augmentation is very important. So in what follows, we will focus on the first workflow.\n",
